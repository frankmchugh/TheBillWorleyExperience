			<summary>The Mushroom Story</summary>
			<p>ONE DAY, I DECIDED TO TAKE VICTORIA, CLARE AND CHRISTOPHER OUT FOR A RIDE.

FIRST STOP WAS TO GO AND LOOK FOR MUSHROOMS.

WE TRIED A FEW PLACES, BUT FOUND NOTHING.

THEN WE SAW A PROMISING FIELD AND OFF THE CHILDREN WENT.

THE GIRLS TOOK THE LOW GROUND

BUT CHRISTOPHER  DISAPPEARED HIGHER UP THE HILL.

THE GIRLS CAME BACK SOON WITH NIL MUSHROOMS.

AFTER A WHILE, CHRISTOPHER CAME BACK CARRYING A FEW MUSHROOMS.

SO WE DECIDED TO GIVE UP THAT JOB.

NEXT PORT OF CALL WAS THE EGG FARM.

IN WE WENT TO SEE THE HUNDRED HENS IN THEIR FRAMES AND THEN

WE SEARCHED OUT MRS CAROL, THE LADY ON DUTY.

THERE WERE MANY TRAYS OF SMALL EGGS FOR SALE AT ONE DOLLAR A TRAY.

MRS CAROL ASKED  THE CHILDREN WHAT WE HAD BEEN DOING,

AND WE RESPONDED THAT WE HAD BEEN SEARCHING FOR MUSHROOMS.

“OH! I DO LOVE MUSHROOMS!” SHE SAID. IMMEDIATELY I WENT TO THE CAR

AND BROUGHT OUT OUR SMALL BAG OF MUSHROOMS AND GAVE THEM TO HER.

SHE WAS OVERCOME WITH JOY AND RESPONDED BY “GIVING US” TWO TRAYS OF EGGS.

THEN I BOUGHT  FIVE MORE TRAYS ,AND THEN WE HEADED HOME.

BUT ,AS I DROVE HOME, I WAS THINKING WHAT TO DO WITH ALL OF THESE EGGS.

WHO  WOULD LIKE A TRAY OF EGGS?

WE WERE ABOUT TO PASS LINDA’S HOUSE. LINDA WAS IN MY MATHS DEPT.

I TOOK OUT A TRAY OF EGGS AND WENT AND KNOCKED ON LINDA’S DOOR.

“I HAVE BROUGHT YOU SOME EGGS.” I SAID,AND HANDED THE TRAY OVER.

“JUST A MINUTE”SHE RESPONDED ANDTAKING THE EGGS WENT INTO HER HOUSE

ONLY TO RETURN WITH A FRESHLY BAKED LOAF OF BREAD.

“FAIR EXCHANGE, IS NO ROBBERY “ SHE SAID.

AND SO WE HEADED HOME, TO BE GREETED BY MY WIFE

WHO SAID” OK! WHERE ARE THE MUSHROOMS”

AND I RESPONDED “ NO MUSHROOMS, BUT HERE ARE SOME TRAYS OF EGGS

AND A FRESHLY MADE LOAF OF BREAD!!”</p>

			<summary>Aunt Jenny visit</summary>
			<p>OUR GANG GATHERED TOGETHER AND ASKED ,”WHERE CAN WE GO TODAY?”
“WE CAN GO BY BUS FOR A CHANGE” I SAID
“LETS GO TO THE BUS STOP, AND WE WILL CATCH THE FIRST BUS THAT COMES”
AS WE
ARRIVED AT THE BUS STOP, I TOTALLED UP THE CASH THAT I HAD AVAILABLE
THE GANG COMPRISED OF ME AND JACK, MICHAEL AND VINCENT, ERIC,AND  JOHN GRIMES.
“HERE COMES THE 18 BUS.” WAS THE CRY.
“OK . WE WILL GO UP AND VISIT AUNT JENNY” I SAID “BUT, I AM SHORT OF A FEW PENNIES
SO, 2 0F YOU WILL HAVE TO RUN UP TO WINDY NOOK, AND THE REST OF US WILL CATCH THE BUS
AND WE WILL WAIT TIL YOU GET THERE.”
ERIC AND JOHN VOLUNTEERED TO DO THE RUNNING
 AND SO WE BOARDED THE BUS, PAID THE FARE AND A MINUTE LATER DISMOUNTED.
AFTER TEN MINUTES, ERIC AND JOHN CAME PUFFING UP THE HILL.
ONCE RESTED, OUR GANG SET OFF TO SEE AUNT JENNY.
THERE WAS A SMALL GARDEN ENTRANCE AND THEN THE MAIN DOOR.
I ORGANISED THE GANG, WITH ME AND JACK AT THE FRONT.
I KNOCKED AT THE DOOR, AND AWAITED AUNT JENNY COMING DOWN HER STAIRS.
THE DOOR INCHED SLOWLY OPEN, AND AUNT JENNY PEERED OUT.
“ HELLO AUNT JENNY” I SAID. “WE HAVE COME TO SEE YOU!”
SHE LOOKED AGHAST AT THE WEIRD GANG OF MINE,
AND SO SHE PAUSED TO  GAIN TIME TO THINK WHAT TO SAY.
COUNTING UP THE GANG, SHE SAID “ WHO WOULD LIKE AN ORANGE?”
WE ALL RESPONDED POSITIVELY, SINCE WE RARELY COULD PURCHASE ORANGES IN THE FELLING.
“ OK ,JUST STAY THERE AND I WILL BRING YOU ORANGE.”
IN TWO MINUTES, THE DOOR OPENED AND OUT CAME AUNT JENNY WITH A COVERED TRAY.
“OK, WHO WANTS ORANGE?” WE ALL PUT OUR HANDS UP, AND SO AUNT JENNY MOVED FORWARD 
AMONGST US GIVING US SMALL PIECES OF ORANGE.[NOT EXACTLY WHAT WE HOPED FOR]
“AND NOW , WHO WOULD LIKE A DRINK?”
MICHAEL AND VINCENT BOTH INDICATED THEIR NEED
“JUST STAY THERE AND I WILL BE BACK IN A MINUTE.”SHE SAID
AND WITHIN A MINUTE ,SHE WAS BACK WITH TWO SMALL CUPS  FULL OF WATER.
NOTHING WAS SAID, THE BOYS THANKED HER FOR THE DRINK.
SO I SAID THANK YOU TOO AND WE DEPARTED FOR THE BUS.
AT THE BUS STOP, I DISCOVERED THAT I ONLY HAD ENOUGH CASH TO COVER
THE FARES OF ALL BUT ONE OF THE GANG.
THE BUS CAME AND  I TOOK CHARGE OF THE BOARDING, 
BUT WHEN IT CAME TO  THE LAST BOY, MICHAEL
I SAID  “NOW MICHAEL , I HAVE NO MONEY LEFT FOR YOUR  BUS FARE
YOU WILL HAVE TO WALK HOME”
HE STARTED TO CRY
 AS I PAID THE BUS CONDUCTOR, MICHAEL CRIED EVEN LOUDER, 
SO THAT HE GOT THE CONDUCTORS ATTENTION.
HE SAID” WHERE DO WANT TO GO LITTLE BOY?”
MICHAEL RESPONDED  “FELLING SQUARE!”
“HOP ON”SAID THE KIND CONDUCTOR.
AND SO WE ALL GOT HOME BY BUS!!

			<summary>I, William Worley - Part 1</summary>
			<p>I , WILLIAM WORLEY, was born in August 1937.

My brother Jack was born in September 1939,

Some people blame him for the start of WORLD WAR 2.

In  August 1940, just before my birthday, my mother took me to the nearest

suitable school for children  of my age [ 3].

To get there, we had to walk up Booth street and across the busy main   road.

and then head up the hill to the HIGH FELLING, Primary school .

Surprisingly, I  was enrolled to begin schooling the next day.

So, promptly at five to nine the next morning, I stood at our doorstep

awaiting the signal to head off alone to this new school.

Yes , at the age of  3years old, it was expected by my mother Ethel.

that I should go alone!!!!

Just as the clock reached 9am,  the AIR RAID SIREN  sounded.

I looked up at my mother , who was at the upstairs window,

expecting to be called inside to go into our Anderson shelter.

But NO!

My mother pointed up the road towards the school

And said “SCHOOL!”

And  basically , I have been there ever since.!!!!!!!!</p>

			</p>Germany invaded Norway in 1941

This enabled the German Airforce to reach the north of England

One night  in late 1941, the Air Raid siren sounded.

I remember that we, as, children were handed through the  bedroom window.

Then  carried  safely into the Anderson Shelter in our backyard.

We could hear our big guns firing at the incoming aircraft.

The raid did not last long, but  we remained in the shelter all night.

Next morning my father, being a builder,  was summoned to a meeting of all

Tyneside  builders.  There had been major damage done to Sunderland,

So all able-bodied workers were ordered to head into Sunderland to help repair,

rebuild, and remove bodies from damaged buildings.

My father never really told us of what he had seen, so we could only guess</p>

			<summary>I, William Worley - Part 3</summary>
			</p> lived   throughout  World War2 in Booth street, Felling, Gateshead, England.

Every street had its dairy, and,  Booth street  had Gordon’s dairy.

There was no real need for  locals to shop there, as Felling high street was only 200 yards away.

Felling high street had Myers  Pork Shop with its queues outside.

Then there were other less important shops like the cobblers, the paper shop, and of course the butchers, all within easy walking distance.

But, Gordons dairy appeared to flourish with local support.

The question is why???

Gordon sold all of the usual necessities   like fruit and veges, milk, and most importantly biscuits.

And you say  “ why biscuits?”

Gordon sold biscuits by weight. So, you could ask for a pound of chocolate biscuits.

He would turn to the vast number of biscuit tins behind himself,

Grab a handful of biscuits, put   them  onto the scales, then taking more he added biscuits

until the scales showed the  correct amount , then he would tip the scales’  dish of biscuits into a paper bag.

Sometimes with a big order, he would over fill the dish, but, here is the point,

He would remove the biscuits, one at a time, until the scales showed the correct weight.

He did not return the surplus   biscuits into the correct   biscuit tin, but since he had handled them,

he  had to  put   them into the broken biscuit tin.  Clearly  with  the  handling of biscuits,

some were broken would got to one of the msny gbig tins of biscuits and so  were cast into the broken biscuits tin.

Poor people would come and ask for a half a pound of broken biscuits, costing six pence.

One day, a very poor old lady came into the shop and ordered a few minor items.

As it happened,   Raymond, Gordon’s son, was on duty.

The lady, counting up her change, then asked for a half a pound of broken biscuits.

Raymond turned to the broken biscuit tin and put in his hand.

All that he brought forth were a few broken biscuits, which he put onto the scales.

Clearly,  he  was short of the weight asked for.

So Raymond turned to another tin, grasped a handful of sound biscuits, broke them,

and added them to the scales until he reached  half a pound.

He poured these biscuits into  a paper bag.

So, the poor lady had her need met by a kind man.

DEAR READER     GO AND DO LIKEWISE</p>

			<summary>I, William Worley - Part 4</summary>
			</p>ONE OF THE POP SONGS OF MID-WAR WAS

YES WE HAVE NO BANANAS, WE HAVE NO BANANAS TODAY

BANANAS CAME FROM  JAMAICA,

AND I SUPPOSE SUGAR CANE WAS  GROWN SOMEWHERE TROPICAL.

SO SWEETS AND CANDY ETC AND EVEN COCA COLA DRINKS ETC

WERE NEVER AVAILABLE.

ONE DAY , I HEARD THAT ANOTHER DAIRY, THAT WE CALLED ‘THE POP SHOP’

HAD A VARIETY OF SUGAR DRINKS FOR SALE.

SO, BROTHER JACK AND I HEADED TOWARDS THE SHOP,

CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY JOHN GRIMES, VINCENT AND MICHAEL MCDONALD,

ALL MEMBERS OF OUR GANG.

THEY, OF COURSE,BEING CATHOLICS,  HAD NO MONEY TO BUY ANYTHING,

BUT, I, RECEIVING POCKET MONEY, EVEN IN THOSE DAYS, ALWAYS  CARRIED  A LITTLE CASH .

AS IT HAPPENED, I HAD ONE SHILLING IN MY POCKET,

SO I COULD BUY  MOST  ITEMS, THAT A DAIRY SOLD.

A BOTTLE OF POP WAS SOLD FOR 4 PENCE, WITH A PENNY BACK

WHEN YOU RETURNED THE BOTTLE.

THE BOTTLES HELD ABOUT HALF A LITRE

I WENT IN ALONE TO GET THE POP, BUT FOUND, ON MY RETURN,

THAT MY GANG HAD SEATED THEMSELVES IN A CIRCLE ON NEARBY GRASS.

I OPENED THE BOTTLE AND TOOK A SWIG OF THIS DELICIOUS POP.

AND THEN, BEING KIND, HANDED THE BOTTLE TO JACK, WHO TOOK A GOOD SWIG.

HE HANDED ON TO VINCENT, WHO TOOK A  DRINK, AND THEN PASSED ON TO HIS BROTHER

MICHAEL, WHO PUT THE BOTTLE TO HIS LIPS, BUT STOPPED TO SAY “IT’S NEARLY EMPTY”

HE RETURNED THE BOTTLE TO HIS LIPS AND FINISHED IT OFF.

“WHAT ABOUT ME!” SAID JOHN, “WHEN DO I GET MY TURN?”

“ NO PROBLEM.” I  SAID,   AND WENT OFF TO THE POP SHOP TO BUY ANOTHER BOTTLE

BUT OF A DIFFERENT VARIETY.

I GOT MY PENNY BACK FOR THE BOTTLE. AND THEN  I  PAID 4 PENCE FOR A  BOTTLE OF GINGER BEER

I SAT DOWN IN THE CIRCLE, OPENED THE BOTTLE, AND , AFTER TAKING A QUICK SWIG,

HANDED THE BOTTLE TO JOHN, WHO TOOK HIS TURN .

THEN ON TO BROTHER JACK AND  INTO THE REST OF THE CIRCLE.

AS WE NEARED THE END OF THE BOTTLE,WHO SHOULD TURN UP BUT ALAN TEASDALE.

“WHAT ARE YOU DOING “ HE SAID

“WE ARE DRINKING POP.” I REPLIED.

“CAN WE JOIN IN TOO?” SAID ALAN , INDICATING A FRIEND OF HIS.

“ TAKE A SEAT , AND I WILL GO AND GET ANOTHER BOTTLE” I SAID

SO, I GOT MY PENNY BACK ON THIS SECOND BOTTLE

AND THEN OFFERED 4 PENCE FOR MORE GINGER BEER  [WELL I LIKE IT YOU KNOW]

I  OPENED THE BOTTLE, TOOK A SIP, AND HANDED ON TO JACK,,

ADDING THE COMMENT  ”ONLY A DRINK NOT A SWIG”

THEN ON TO ALAN AND THEN HIS FRIEND.

IT WAS THEN THAT WE ALL NOTICED THAT ALANS FRIEND HAD A RUNNY NOSE.

NOT JUST RUNNY , BUT GREEN STUFF STICKING TO HIS UPPER LIP.

THIS  GUY TOOK MORE THAN A DRINK, WHILST  WE ALL LOOKED AT HIM IN AMAZEMENT.

THE BOTTLE WAS THEN PASSED ON TO VINCENT.

HE TOOK OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF, WIPED THE MOUTH OF THE BOTTLE AND THEN

CAREFULLY  HAD A DRINK. THE BOTTLE THEN WAS PASSED ON SLOWLY AROUND THE CIRCLE.

BUT EVEN WITH MORE CAREFUL DRINKS, THE BOTTLE WAS SOON EMPTY.

COMING BACK TO ALAN’S TURN, HE SAID “ITS EMPTY”

AND HE HANDED  BACK THE BOTTLE TO ME, SAYING  “CAN WE HAVE ANOTHER BOTTLE?”

IT WAS THEN THAT I DISCOVERED THAT WHEN TOOK BACK THE PRESENT BOTTLE

THEN I WOULD ONLY HAVE 3 PENCE  LEFT AND I NEEDED  4 PENCE FOR ANOTHER BOTTLE

“CAN’T DO IT .” I SAID “ I NEED ANOTHER PENNY”

“ I WILL LEND YOU A PENNY “ SAID ALAN.

THIS HE DID, AND OFF I WENT TO GET THE LAST BOTTLE.

STARTING WITH ALAN, THE BOTTLE WAS THEN PASSED TO HIS FRIEND,

THEN TO THE APPREHENSIVE VINCENT, WHO DID HIS TIDY UP JOB ON THE BOTTLE MOUTH

THEN ON AROUND THE CIRCLE UNTIL  THE  POP RAN OUT.

“WELL THAT’S IT” I SAID.”SEE YOU ALL LATER”

“WHAT ABOUT MY PENNY?” SAID ALAN.

I WENT ACROSS TO THE POP SHOP AND GOT MY PENNY BACK ON THE BOTTLE

AND GAVE IT TO ALAN.

YOU KNOW      SOME PEOPLE JUST  DON’T GET IT!!!

			<summary>I, William Worley - Part 5</summary>
			</p>WORLD WAR 2 ENDED IN 1945, WITH THE SURRENDERS OF GERMANY AND JAPAN.

GREAT BRITAIN CELEBRATED THIS VICTORY  IN VARIOUS WAYS AND PLACES.

ONE EVENING, AFTER WORK, MY MOTHER AND FATHER  WITH JACK AND ME

ALL HEADED  DOWN  FELLING HIGH STREET TO THE TRAM RANK.

WE CAUGHT A TRAM INTO GATESHEAD, AND THEN WE TOOK ANOTHER TRAM UP THE HILL

TOWARDS SHERIFF HILL. THEN WE WALKED DOWN INTO SALTWELL PARK.

HUGE  CROWDS  HAD GATHERED THERE TO WATCH A CELEBRATION OF SONG AND DANCE.

WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER THE PROBLEM EMERGED. HOW COULD WE GET HOME?

MY PARENTS DECIDED TO USE THE REVERSE ROUT AND  ALL WORKED OUT NICELY.

EASY PEASY!!!                 

SO, NEXT DAY, NOW AT THE AGE OF 8 YEARS OLD, I DECIDED THAT I WOULD LIKE TO GO TO 

SALTWELL PARK AGAIN.

FROM OUR BACKYARD, I PICKED UP A FISHING NET AND A JAR FOR CATCHING TIDDLERS

IN SALTWELL PARKS LAKE. I TOLD JACK WHERE WE WERE GOING, TOOK A FEW PENNIES FROM

MOTHERS SMALL CASH TRAY ON THE MANTLEPIECE AND SET OFF,

 NEVER TELLING MOTHER   WHAT I WAS PLANNING TO DO.

THERE WAS AN EASY ROUT, WHICH MY  PARENTS HAD OVERLOOKED,

AND THAT WAS TO TAKE THE NUMBER 18  BUS STRAIGHT TO SALTWELL PARK.

IT ONLY COST US KIDS A PENNY TO GET THERE ON THE BUS. SO, NO PROBLEM!

WE WANDERED ABOUT FOR A WHILE LOOKING OVER THE TENTS AND EQUIPMENT

THAT HAD BEEN IN USE THE PREVIOUS NIGHT.

THEN WE TRIED TO CATCH TIDDLERS IN THE LAKE WITH THE FISHING NET, BUT WITHOUT  SUCCESS.

SOME PEOPLE DECIDED TO HELP US DO THIS, BUT THEY ENDED UP USING THE NET

AND SENT US ON A WILD GOOSE CHASE TO THE OTHER END OF THE LAKE.

AFTER A FEW MINUTES OF WAITING, WE LOST SIGHT OF THESE PEOPLE.

WE RETURNED TO THE SPOT WHERE WE HAD MET THEM

BUT FOUND NO-ONE, AND NO NET AND NO JAR.

SO THAT WAS THAT, SO I THOUGHT THAT WE MIGHT AS WELL GO HOME.

JACK AND I WALKED OVER TO THE BUS STOP AND WAITED.

IT WAS HOMETIME FOR WORKMEN. THE BUSES WERE CRAMMED FULL

BUSES WOULD NOT STOP, WHEN WE WAIVED.  SO WE WERE STUCK.

 

HOW WOULD WE GET HOME?

COMING TO THE BUS STOP WERE VARIOUS WORKMEN, WHO WERE ALSO ANNOYED THAT THE

BUSES DID NOT STOP. THEN,  INTO THE QUEUE AT THE BUS STOP CAME BOBBY CHARLTON,

A NEIGHBOUR FROM BOOTH STREET.  HE, TOO, SOON GOT TIRED OF WAITING FOR A BUS.

HE TALKED WITH US, AND SAID THAT HE WOULD BE WALKING HOME.

HE THEN PROPOSED THAT WE SHOULD WALK WITH HIM.

I  AGREED, BUT, HAD NOT NOTICED THAT OUR JACK WAS TIRED.

WE SET OFF ON THIS 2 MILE WALK, BUT AFTER TEN MINUTES

IT WAS CLEAR THAT JACK WAS GOING VERY SLOWLY

SO, BOBBY, WHO WAS  A  FIT  YOUNG MAN,  HOISTED JACK ONTO HIS SHOULDERS

AND WE SET OFF DOWN THE HILL AT A GOOD PACE.

30 MINUTES LATER WE ENTERED BOOTH ST.

SOMEONE WAS SHOUTING VERY LOUDLY  “BILLY….JACK….BILLY …JACK”

ALL THE NEIGHBOURS IN THE STREET WERE LOOKING OUT OF THEIR WINDOWS

TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON.  “BILLY…JACK…BILLY …JACK”

AS WE APPROACHED   OUR   HOUSE, BOBBY LIFTED JACK FROM HIS SHOULDERS.

MOTHER SAW US. STOPPED   SHOUTING, AND SAID “WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?”

AND I RESPONDED “SALTWELL PARK!”</p>
